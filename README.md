Textual and Graph Embedding Neural Recommender - TGENR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Author: Omer Tal

### Requirements
To run the model, the following enviornment is required:

Python 3.5

Numpy 1.13.3

Scipy 1.0.0

Keras 2.1.2

TensorFlow 1.4.0

### How to run
### Data preprocssing
python3 data_preprocess.py

The required dataset should be in dataset/ directory where the following files are expected:

	review.json - Yelp's review file
	
	business.json - Yelp's location file
	
	user.json - Yelp's users file
	
	glove.6B.50d.txt - GloVE text embedding file for embedding size of 50

### Model creation, training and evaluation
 python3 train_tgenr.py
 
Required preprocessed files in preprocessed/combined_model/141k/ where the following files are expected (generated by preprocssing):

	train.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary holding training samples (user,location,score)
	
	test.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary holding test samples
	
	validation.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary holding validation samples
	
	reviews.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary holding all words used by user and for location
	
	user_graph.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary representing the edges for a given user
	
	poi_graph.pkl - pickle file with a dictionary representing the edges for a given location
	
	glove_file.pkl - pickle file for the altered text embedding file
	

### All parameters are set manually within the two files
